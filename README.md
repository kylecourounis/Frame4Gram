# Frame4Gram
I wrote this PHP application back in 2018 to frame images with a watermarked frame for my Instagram. While I never really used it, it was a fun project to expand my knowledge on PHP form submission and to learn how to use the html2canvas JavaScript library. 

You can test out the web application here: https://frame4gram.herokuapp.com/
